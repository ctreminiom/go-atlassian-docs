# ðŸŽ‘ Introduction

The _go-atlassian_ `confluence` module provides a set of functions and types for interacting with the Jira Service Management REST API. It  enables you to create, retrieve, update, and delete various types of content within Confluence, manage spaces, access version information, and perform searches.

1. **Content**: The Content API allows you to manage the content within Confluence Cloud. You can create, retrieve, update, and delete pages, blog posts, comments, attachments, and more. You can also perform actions such as moving or copying content within Confluence.
2. **Spaces**: The Spaces API provides functionality to manage spaces within Confluence Cloud. You can create, retrieve, update, and delete spaces, as well as manage permissions and restrictions associated with them. Spaces are essentially containers for organizing and categorizing content in Confluence.
3. **Versions**: The Versions API allows you to work with version information related to content in Confluence Cloud. You can retrieve version details, compare versions, and perform actions such as reverting to previous versions or deleting versions.
4. **Search**: The Search API enables you to perform powerful searches within Confluence Cloud. You can search for specific content, spaces, or attachments using various criteria like keywords, labels, authors, and more. The API provides flexibility to refine search results and retrieve relevant information.
