# ðŸ”Š REST API V2

{% embed url="https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/the-confluence-cloud-rest-api-v2-brings-major-performance-improvements/" %}

Last October, we released [the first REST API V2 endpoints for Confluence Cloud](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/release-of-v2-confluence-rest-api-for-pages-and-blogposts-experimental/62164), which enabled developers to fetch pages and blogposts. Weâ€™ve continued to expand the surface area of the V2 API, and we are now happy to announce the release of V2 endpoints related to the following data types:

* attachments
* blogposts
* comments
* custom content
* labels
* pages
* spaces
* space properties
* versions

These endpoints support Connect scopes and granular OAuth 2.0 scopes.

The REST API V2 offers two main improvements over previous versions: **endpoint specialization** and **lower request latency**. Endpoints that have specific, restricted scope behave predictably, are easier to optimize, and are compatible with our commitment to granular OAuth 2.0 scopes.
