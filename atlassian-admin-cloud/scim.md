 The [user provisioning REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/user-provisioning/rest/intro/) manages an integration between an external user directory and your Atlassian cloud products so you can automatically update the users and groups in your Atlassian organization when you make updates in your identity provider \(IdP\). For example, with user provisioning, you can create, link, and deactivate managed Atlassian user accounts from your IdP. We support user provisioning using the System for Cross-domain Identity Management \(SCIM\) protocol version 2.0
