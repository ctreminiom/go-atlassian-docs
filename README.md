```

## Usage ‚úíÔ∏è

All interaction starts with a `jira.Client` struct. Create one with your Atlassian site host URL and a custom HTTP client if it's necessary.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "github.com/ctreminiom/go-atlassian/jira"
    "log"
    "os"
)

func main() {

    var (
        host  = os.Getenv("HOST")
        mail  = os.Getenv("MAIL")
        token = os.Getenv("TOKEN")
    )

    // You can set custom *http.Client here
    jiraCloud, err := jira.New(nil, host)
    if err != nil {
        return
    }

    jiraCloud.Auth.SetBasicAuth(mail, token)
    jiraCloud.Auth.SetUserAgent("curl/7.54.0")

    applicationRoles, response, err := jiraCloud.Role.Gets(context.Background())
    if err != nil {
        if response != nil {
            log.Println("Response HTTP Response", string(response.BodyAsBytes))
        }
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    log.Println("Response HTTP Code", response.StatusCode)
    log.Println("HTTP Endpoint Used", response.Endpoint)

    for _, applicationRole := range *applicationRoles {
        log.Printf("Application Role Name: %v", applicationRole.Name)
        log.Printf("Application Role Key: %v", applicationRole.Key)
        log.Printf("Application Role User Count: %v", applicationRole.UserCount)
    }
