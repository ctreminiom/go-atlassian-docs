Documentation is hosted live at [https://docs.go-atlassian.io/](https://docs.go-atlassian.io)

## üìù Usage

More examples in `jira/examples` `admin/examples` `jira/sm/examples` directories. Here's a short example of how to get a Jira Issue:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "github.com/ctreminiom/go-atlassian/jira"
    "log"
    "os"
)

func main() {

    var (
        host  = os.Getenv("HOST")
        mail  = os.Getenv("MAIL")
        token = os.Getenv("TOKEN")
    )

    atlassian, err := jira.New(nil, host)
    if err != nil {
        return
    }

    atlassian.Auth.SetBasicAuth(mail, token)

    issue, response, err := atlassian.Issue.Get(context.Background(), "KP-12", nil, []string{"transitions"})
    if err != nil {
        if response != nil {
            log.Println("Response HTTP Response", response.Bytes.String())
            log.Println(response.Code)
        }
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    log.Println("Response HTTP Code", response.Code)
    log.Println("HTTP Endpoint Used", response.Endpoint)

    log.Println(issue.Key)
    log.Println(issue.Fields.Reporter.AccountID)

    for _, transition := range issue.Transitions {
        log.Println(transition.Name, transition.ID, transition.To.ID, transition.HasScreen)
    }

}
```
